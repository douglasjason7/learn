# Meta Front End Course by Coursera

Here I'm put some results of Meta Front End Course by Coursera. Some codes of challenges I've made.
I separete the challenges into separete folders, this way I can revisit and consult the codes when I need.

__This courses are part of a learning program that I create to transit from UI Designer to Fullstack UI Designer journey.__

In this course of Meta, I've learning the following:

1. Html and CSS;
2. JavaScript;
3. React.js;
4. More coming soon...
